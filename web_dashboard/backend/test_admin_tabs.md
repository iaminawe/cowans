   - Can see: Sync, Products, Analytics, Collections, Categories, Icons, Admin tabs
   - Scripts and Logs are accessible within Admin Dashboard
   - Admin Dashboard now has 6 tabs: Overview, Users, Jobs, System, Scripts, Logs

## Testing Steps

3. Navigate to Admin Dashboard and verify Scripts and Logs tabs are present
4. Test Scripts tab functionality within Admin Dashboard
5. Test Logs tab functionality within Admin Dashboard
