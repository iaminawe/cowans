# Shopify Product Sync Implementation

## Overview

The Shopify product sync functionality has been fully implemented with real API integration, replacing the previous mock/simulation code. The system can now sync products from a Shopify store with 24,535+ products to the local database.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. GraphQL API Integration
- Switched from deprecated REST API to GraphQL API (2024-10 version)
- Handles large product datasets efficiently
- Includes all product details: variants, images, metafields, SEO data

### 2. Rate Limit Handling
- **Exponential backoff retry mechanism**: Automatically retries with 2s, 4s, 8s delays
- **Partial sync support**: Returns success even when rate limited
- **Progress tracking**: Shows percentage of products synced
- **Resumable sync**: Stores cursor to continue from where it left off

### 3. Field Mapping
Fixed database model incompatibilities:
- `vendor` → `brand` and `manufacturer`
- `product_type` → removed (not in current model)
- `tags` → removed (not in current model)
- `barcode` → `upc`
- `variant_option1/2/3` → stored in `custom_attributes` JSON

### 4. Frontend Enhancements
- Shows "Continue Sync" button when rate limited
- Displays sync progress percentage
- Clear messaging about rate limits and resuming
- Real-time progress updates

## Usage

### Initial Sync
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3560/api/shopify/products/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-token" \
  -d '{"include_draft": true}'
```

### Resume Sync (after rate limit)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3560/api/shopify/products/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dev-token" \
  -d '{"include_draft": true, "resume_cursor": "<cursor_from_previous_response>"}'
```

## Response Format

### Successful Partial Sync (Rate Limited)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Sync partially completed. Processed 800 of 24535 products (3.3%) before hitting rate limits. Please run sync again to continue.",
  "results": {
    "total_products": 800,
    "created": 0,
    "updated": 800,
    "skipped": 0,
    "errors": 0,
    "error_details": [],
    "store_total": 24535
  },
  "rate_limited": true,
  "progress": {
    "processed": 800,
    "total": 24535,
    "percentage": 3.26
  },
  "resume_cursor": "eyJsYXN0X2lkIjo4ODA4NjI0NzUwODQ5LCJsYXN0X3ZhbHVlIjoiODgwODYyNDc1MDg0OSJ9"
}
```

## Rate Limits

- Shopify GraphQL API has a points-based system
- Typically processes 600-800 products before hitting limits
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Can resume sync after waiting a few seconds

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `/web_dashboard/backend/services/shopify_product_sync_service.py` - Core sync logic
- `/web_dashboard/backend/shopify_sync_api.py` - API endpoints
- `/frontend/src/components/ShopifyProductSyncManager.tsx` - UI component

### Environment Variables Required
- `SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL` - e.g., "e19833-4.myshopify.com"
- `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` - API access token with product read permissions

## Known Issues
- WebSocket errors in logs (non-critical)
- Database corruption for sync_history table (doesn't affect product sync)

## Future Improvements
- Implement Shopify Bulk Operations API for very large stores
- Add webhook support for real-time updates
- Implement incremental sync based on last modified dates
- Add background job processing for long-running syncs
