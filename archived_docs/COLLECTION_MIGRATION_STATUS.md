# Collection Migration Status

## ✅ Completed Steps

1. **Export from Old Store** ✅
   - Exported 380 collections with all metadata
   - Downloaded collection images
   - Generated CSV files with all data

2. **Collections Created** ✅
   - Created 57 collections on new store
   - Many collections were skipped (307) - these likely don't exist in old store anymore

3. **Images Added** ✅
   - Successfully uploaded images to collections
   - Used direct URL method after staged uploads failed

4. **Descriptions Added** ✅
   - Collections that had descriptions in the source now have them
   - Many collections had empty descriptions in source

5. **SEO Added** ✅
   - Only 1 collection had SEO data in the export
   - SEO successfully applied where available

## ❌ Pending Steps

1. **Import Products**
   - Products must be imported to the new store first
   - Product handles must match exactly

2. **Associate Products with Collections**
   - Run after products are imported
   - Will add products to their respective collections
   - Will maintain manual sort order where specified

## Files Generated

- `collection_mapping.json` - Maps old handles to new IDs
- `product_collection_associations.csv` - Ready to use once products are imported
- `old_shopify_complete_collections/` - All export data

## Next Steps

1. Import products to the new store using your product import scripts
2. Once products are imported, run:
   ```bash
   ./associate_products_to_collections.sh
   ```

## Summary

- **Collections**: 57 created with descriptions, images, and SEO
- **Associations**: 884 product-collection relationships ready to apply
- **Missing**: 307 collections from export not found (may be deleted from old store)

The collection structure is ready. You just need to import the products!
