## Usage Examples

### Basic Dashboard Card
```tsx

>
  <DashboardCard />
  <DashboardCard />
  <DashboardCard />
</ResponsiveGrid>
```

### Loading States
```tsx
{loading ? (
  <DashboardCardSkeleton />
) : error ? (
  <ErrorState onRetry={handleRetry} />
) : data.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState icon={<Database />} />
) : (
  <DataView data={data} />
)}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Theme Switcher**: Light/dark mode toggle
2. **Layout Preferences**: User-customizable layouts
3. **Advanced Animations**: Page transitions and micro-interactions
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
5. **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced screen reader support

### Technical Debt
- Consider implementing CSS-in-JS for better theming
- Add comprehensive unit tests for responsive utilities
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add performance monitoring and optimization

## Migration Guide

### From Old Layout
1. Replace `DashboardLayout` imports with enhanced version
2. Update card components to use new variant system
3. Add loading states to data-dependent components
4. Implement responsive containers where needed
5. Update navigation to use `NavigationTabs` component

### Breaking Changes
- `DashboardCard` now supports `variant` and `loading` props
- `DashboardGrid` has new `columns` configuration
- Navigation structure has been moved to dedicated component
- CSS classes have been enhanced with new utilities

This enhanced layout system provides a modern, responsive, and accessible foundation for the Cowans Office Supplies Dashboard while maintaining backwards compatibility and improving user experience across all device types.
