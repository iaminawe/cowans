## Integration Workflows

### 1. Parallel Sync Workflow ✅
```
User Input → ParallelSyncControl → parallel_sync_api → ParallelSyncEngine
    ↓                                                            ↓
WebSocket Updates ← SyncPerformanceMonitor ← Worker Pools
```

### 2. Batch Operations Workflow ✅
```
Product Selection → BatchProcessor → batch_api → Batch Queue
    ↓                                                   ↓
Progress Updates ← WebSocket ← Batch Workers
```

### 3. Enhanced Sync Workflow ✅
```
Shopify Down → Staging Tables → Change Review → Approval → Shopify Up
    ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓           ↓
WebSocket ← Database ← UI Updates ← User Action ← Sync Engine
```
