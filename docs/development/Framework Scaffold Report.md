# Framework Scaffold Report

This report summarizes the framework scaffolding activities performed for the Shopify Product Feed Integration System.

## Project Goal

To create an automated system that synchronizes product data between Etilize and Shopify.

## Phase 2.1: Set up Frontend Project

### Description

Initialize React/TypeScript project with required dependencies.

### AI Verifiable Deliverable:

-   Frontend project structure exists
-   `package.json` with required dependencies
-   Build process succeeds without errors

### Activities Performed:

1.  **DevOps Foundations Setup:** The initial project structure was created, including the `frontend` directory with `src`, `public`, and `components` subdirectories. A `package.json` file was created in the `frontend` directory with the required dependencies for a React/TypeScript project, including `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `typescript`, `webpack`, and `webpack-cli`.
2.  **Framework Boilerplate Generation:** Boilerplate code was generated for the React/TypeScript frontend project. This included setting up basic component structure, routing, and a landing page. The following files were created:
    -   `frontend/package.json` - Updated with React, TypeScript, and React Router dependencies
    -   `frontend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with React-specific settings
    -   `frontend/src/index.tsx` - Application entry point with routing setup
    -   `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main application component with routing configuration
    -   `frontend/src/components/LandingPage.tsx` - Basic landing page component
    -   `frontend/public/index.html` - HTML template with root mounting point
    -   `frontend/src/styles.css` - Base styles for the application
3.  **Test Harness Setup:** A test harness was set up for the React/TypeScript frontend project. Test files were created for the SyncControl and LogViewer components. Basic rendering tests were implemented for all the main components: Landing Page, SyncControl, and LogViewer. All tests passed successfully. The following files were created:
    -   `frontend/src/components/SyncControl.test.tsx`
    -   `frontend/src/components/LogViewer.test.tsx`
    -   `frontend/src/components/SyncControl.tsx`
    -   `frontend/src/components/LogViewer.tsx`

### Tools Used:

-   `new_task` (to delegate tasks to worker modes)
-   `list_files` (to verify file creation)
-   `execute_command` (to run tests)

### Initial Project Structure:

```
frontend/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── LandingPage.tsx
│   │   ├── LandingPage.test.tsx
│   │   ├── SyncControl.test.tsx
│   │   ├── LogViewer.test.tsx
│   │   ├── SyncControl.tsx
│   │   └── LogViewer.tsx

```

### AI Verifiable Outcome:

The frontend project structure now exists with the required dependencies and a basic test suite. The build process should succeed without errors.
