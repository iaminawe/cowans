# Detailed Analysis: Etilize-Shopify Integration

This section provides a detailed analysis of the key aspects of integrating Etilize data with a Shopify store, covering data transformation strategies and cost considerations.

## Optimal Data Transformation Approach

Transforming Etilize data to match Shopify's product model requires a structured approach that balances efficiency, scalability, and data integrity. The following steps outline the recommended process:

1.  **Pre-Migration Planning & Data Auditing:**
    *   **Comprehensive data inventory:** Catalog all source data types including SKUs, product descriptions, variants (size/color), inventory levels, customer reviews, and SEO metadata.
    *   **Data quality assessment:**
        *   Remove duplicate entries (e.g., identical products listed under different SKUs)
        *   Standardize inconsistent formats (e.g., "$19.99" vs "19.99 USD")
        *   Identify legacy fields requiring transformation (e.g., converting "Prod_Cat" to Shopify's "Product Type")

    *Example:* A fashion retailer migrating 50,000 SKUs discovered 12% of color attributes used non-standard terms like "Navy Blue" and "Navy" â€“ consolidated to a single value.

2.  **Field Mapping & Transformation Logic:**
    *   **Core Shopify product model components:**

        | Source Field       | Shopify Field      | Transformation Rule                     |
        | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
        | ItemID             | SKU                | Direct mapping                          |
        | LongDesc           | Description        | HTML sanitization + emoji removal       |
        | Size\_Options       | Variants           | Split "S/M/L" into separate variants    |
        | CustomAttribute    | Metafield          | JSON formatting for size charts          |

    *   **Variant handling:** Convert product hierarchies like "Base Product + Size Options" into Shopify's variant system. For example:

        Product: Men's T-Shirt
        Variants: Small (SKU: TSHIRT-S), Medium (SKU: TSHIRT-M)
