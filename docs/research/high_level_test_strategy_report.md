# High-Level Test Strategy Report: Cowans Office Supplies Shopify Integration

## Introduction

This report outlines a comprehensive high-level testing strategy for a Shopify product feed integration application. The strategy emphasizes methodologies, test types, best practices, and adherence to the principles of good high-level tests. It covers real data usage, recursion, real-life scenarios, launch readiness, and API integrations to ensure a robust and reliable system.

## Core Testing Methodologies

*   **Real Data Validation:** Implement shadow traffic routing to compare feed outputs against legacy systems using production data subsets. Conduct schema enforcement tests using marketplace specifications (e.g., Google Shopping feed requirements). Validate localized data handling through multi-region context simulations (Shopify's localized webhook payloads).
*   **Recursive Sync Testing:**
    1.  Test full sync initialization (`productFullSync` API) with:
        *   Empty catalog baseline
        *   10k+ product stress tests
        *   Interrupted sync recovery scenarios
    2.  Validate partial updates through webhook sequence:
        `PRODUCT_CREATE -> PRODUCT_UPDATE -> INVENTORY_LEVEL_UPDATE`
    3.  Implement circular reference detection for product relationships

## Critical Test Types

| Test Category        | Key Verification Points                               | Tools/Techniques                  |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| API Contract         | Rate limits, error codes, authentication flows        | Postman, HTTPie, VCR.py           |
| Data Transformation  | Currency conversion, attribute mapping                | Great Expectations, dbt\_test     |
| Performance          | 99th percentile latency under load                      | Locust, k6                        |
| Failure Recovery     | Mid-sync interruption handling                        | Chaos Monkey, Toxiproxy             |
| Security             | Protection of API Keys and Credentials, secure transmission of data | OWASP ZAP, Nmap                   |

## Real-World Scenario Examples

*   **Inventory clash:** Simulate concurrent updates from Shopify admin and feed API.
*   **Multi-marketplace sync:** Test conflicting attribute requirements between platforms.
*   **Historical data drift:** Compare current feed output against a 6-month-old valid dataset.
*   **Data Volume Thresholds:** Testing the system's performance and stability with different data volumes. For example, testing with 100 products, 1000 products, 10,000 products, and 100,000 products to identify any performance bottlenecks or limitations.

## Launch Readiness Checklist

1.  **Pre-Flight Validation**
    *   Conduct final full sync with production credentials.
    *   Verify webhook sequencing (`PRODUCT_FEEDS_FULL_SYNC_FINISH`).
    *   Confirm error logging meets marketplace compliance standards.
2.  **Rollback Strategy**
    *   Maintain v1/v2 feed API endpoints during transition.
    *   Implement automated schema version snapshotting.
    *   Test fallback to previous product catalog version.
3.  **Post-Launch Monitoring**
    *   Track feed rejection rates per marketplace.
    *   Monitor attribute completeness metrics.
    *   Alert on sync duration percentile increases.

## Principles of Good High-Level Tests

The testing strategy adheres to the following principles of good high-level tests:

*   **Understandable:** Tests are written in a clear and concise manner, easily understood by stakeholders.
*   **Maintainable:** The test suite is designed to be easily updated and maintained as the application evolves.
*   **Independent:** Tests are independent of each other, avoiding dependencies that can lead to cascading failures.
*   **Reliable:** Tests produce consistent results, minimizing false positives and negatives.
*   **Feedback:** Tests provide clear and actionable feedback, enabling developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## API Integrations Testing

*   **Authentication:** Verify that the application can authenticate with the Shopify API and the Etilize FTP server using valid credentials.
*   **Data Transfer:** Ensure that product data is transferred correctly between the Etilize FTP server and the Shopify API.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement tests to verify that the application handles API rate limits gracefully, avoiding errors and ensuring that all data is synchronized.
*   **Error Handling:** Test the application's ability to handle API errors, such as invalid product data or connection errors.

## Real Data Usage

*   **Data Masking:** Implement data masking techniques to protect sensitive data while using real data in testing.
*   **Data Subsetting:** Use a subset of real data to reduce the testing time and resource requirements.
*   **Data Generation:** Generate realistic test data that mimics real-world scenarios.

## Recursion Testing

*   **Product Hierarchies:** Test the application's ability to handle product hierarchies and categories with nested structures.
*   **Sync Processes:** Implement recursive sync processes to ensure that the application can recover from failures and maintain data consistency.

## Real-Life Scenarios

*   **Peak Sales:** Simulate peak sales periods to test the application's ability to handle high traffic and data volumes.
*   **Promotional Events:** Test the application's ability to handle promotional events, such as discounts and sales.
*   **Inventory Changes:** Simulate frequent inventory changes to test the application's ability to keep the product catalog up-to-date.

## Conclusion

This high-level testing strategy provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality and reliability of the Shopify product feed integration application. By adhering to the principles of good high-level tests and covering all critical aspects of the system, the testing strategy will help to minimize risks and ensure a successful launch.
