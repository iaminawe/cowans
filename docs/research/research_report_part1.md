# Research Report: Shopify Import Application

## Introduction

This report summarizes the research conducted to inform the development of a Shopify import application that automates the process of downloading, extracting, sanitizing, and synchronizing product data from Etilize.

## Primary Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

*   Automate the ingestion of product data from Etilize.
*   Transform and sanitize the data for compatibility with Shopify.
*   Synchronize product listings in Shopify with the transformed Etilize data.

## Key Features

*   Automated FTP download of Etilize data.
*   Extraction of data from ZIP files and CSVs.
*   Data transformation and sanitization.
*   Consolidation of metadata into a JSON metafield.
*   Shopify API integration for product creation and updates.
*   Logging and status reporting.
*   (Phase 2+) Web dashboard for manual sync triggering and log viewing.
*   (Phase 3+) Secure user authentication and scheduled syncs.

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   The system must automatically download the latest product data from Etilize's FTP server.
    *   The system must transform the Etilize data to match Shopify's product data model.
    *   The system must handle large product catalogs efficiently, processing data in chunks.
    *   The system must provide a way to manually trigger a data synchronization.
    *   The system must log all actions and errors.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    *   The system must be secure, protecting sensitive credentials.
    *   The system must be scalable to handle increasing product data volumes.
    *   The system must be reliable and fault-tolerant.
    *   The system must be maintainable and easy to update.

## Success Metrics

The success of this project will be measured by:

*   The degree to which the system automates the Etilize to Shopify product data integration process.
*   The accuracy and consistency of the product data in Shopify.
*   The time savings achieved compared to the manual process.
*   The reliability and stability of the system.

## Key Entities

*   Product
*   Etilize Data Feed
*   Shopify Product Listing
*   Metadata
*   Sync Process
*   User (Phase 3)

## Data Structures

*   Etilize CSV Data (column headers and data types - see data_feed_details.md)
*   Shopify Product JSON (as defined by Shopify API)
*   JSON Metafield (custom JSON structure for product details)

## Scripts

*   `create_metafields.py` - Consolidates metadata columns into a JSON metafield for Shopify.
*   `remove_empty_columns.py` - Removes empty columns from the original Etilize CSV data.

## Technologies

*   Python (for backend processing)
*   Pandas (for data manipulation)
*   Shopify Admin API
*   FTP protocol
*   (Phase 3) React/TypeScript for the UI.
*   (Phase 3) Supabase for data persistence and auth.

## Security Considerations

*   Securely storing Etilize FTP credentials and Shopify API keys (see security_best_practices.md).

## Out of Scope

*   Full Shopify theme customization.
*   Advanced image processing or optimization.
*   Support for data sources beyond the specified Etilize FTP feed.

## Progress and Next Steps

The research has identified the specifics of the Etilize data feed and has also begun investigating security best practices. The knowledge gaps have been partially filled.

Next steps will involve research into the optimal data transformation approach.
