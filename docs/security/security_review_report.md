# Security Review Report

**Reviewed Files:**
- [`scripts/ftp_downloader.py`](../../scripts/utilities/ftp_downloader.py)

- [`tests/acceptance/core_functionality_tests.py`](../../tests/acceptance/core_functionality_tests.py)

## 1. Hardcoded Credentials

**Finding:**  
No hardcoded credentials were found in any production code.

- [`scripts/ftp_downloader.py`](../../scripts/utilities/ftp_downloader.py:26-181):  
  - Credentials (`host`, `username`, `password`) are passed as parameters and sourced from environment variables (`os.getenv(...)` at lines 166-168).
  - No sensitive values are present in the codebase.
- [`scripts/shopify_uploader.py`](../../scripts/shopify/shopify_uploader.py:47-262):  
  - Shopify credentials (`shop_url`, `access_token`) are sourced from environment variables (`os.getenv(...)` at lines 240-241).
  - No hardcoded tokens or secrets.
- [`tests/acceptance/core_functionality_tests.py`](../../tests/acceptance/core_functionality_tests.py:1-273):  
  - Test credentials (e.g., `"test_user"`, `"test_pass"`, `"test_token"`) are used only in mocks and fixtures for isolated testing, not in production logic.

**Remediation:**  
No action required. Secure credential management is in place.

## 2. New Vulnerabilities

**Finding:**  
No new vulnerabilities or insecure coding patterns were introduced in the reviewed files.

- All sensitive operations (FTP, API) use environment variables for secrets.
- Error handling is present and does not leak sensitive information.
- Logging is used appropriately and does not expose secrets.
- Test code does not affect production security posture.

---

## 3. Additional Observations

- **Threat Modeling:**  
  - Attack surface is minimized by not exposing credentials in code.
  - No evidence of insecure default values or weak cryptography.
  - No direct file or command injection risks observed.

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use of context managers for resource cleanup.
  - Parameter validation and error handling are present.
  - Rate limiting and API error handling are implemented.

---

## 4. Recommendations

- Continue to use environment variables for all secrets.
- Periodically review dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Ensure environment variables are securely managed in deployment environments.

## 5. Vulnerability Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical |   0   |
| High     |   0   |
| Medium   |   0   |
| Low      |   0   |

## 6. Self-Reflection

This review used static analysis and manual inspection of all specified files. The scope included credential management, error handling, and secure coding practices. No high, critical, or minor vulnerabilities were found. The review is comprehensive for the files listed, but ongoing vigilance is recommended as part of a secure SDLC.
