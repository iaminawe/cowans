## FAQ

**Q: Why do some products show blue checkmarks instead of green?**
A: Blue checkmarks indicate products that have Shopify IDs but haven't been synced recently. They're likely synchronized but the system hasn't explicitly confirmed their status.

**Q: Can I sync products without reviewing changes?**
A: No, the staging system requires review for safety. However, you can use "Bulk Approve" to quickly approve all changes after a brief review.

**Q: How often should I sync?**
A: Daily incremental syncs are recommended, with weekly full syncs for verification. Adjust based on your update frequency.

**Q: What happens if I lose connection during sync?**
A: The system will attempt to resume when connection is restored. Long operations are chunked to prevent data loss.

**Q: Can I cancel a sync operation?**
A: Yes, click the "Cancel" button next to the progress bar. Already processed items will remain, but pending items will be skipped.
