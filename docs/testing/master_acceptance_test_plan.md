# Master Acceptance Test Plan: Shopify Product Feed Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the master acceptance test plan for the Shopify product feed integration application. The plan covers all aspects of the application, from core functionality to real-world scenarios and performance and security. Each test case has a clearly defined AI verifiable completion criterion.

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Tests

*   **Test Case 1.1: FTP Connection and Data Download**
    *   Description: Verify that the application can connect to the Etilize FTP server, download the product data file, and extract the CSV file.
    *   Completion Criterion: The application successfully connects to the FTP server, downloads the file, and extracts the CSV file without errors. The presence of the CSV file in the designated directory is programmatically verifiable.
*   **Test Case 1.2: Data Transformation**
    *   Description: Verify that the application can read and transform the product data from the CSV file, including combining multiple product specification columns into a single JSON formatted field.
    *   Completion Criterion: The application successfully reads the CSV file, transforms the data, and creates a JSON formatted field for product specifications. The generated JSON field conforms to the expected schema and data types, which is programmatically verifiable.
*   **Test Case 1.3: Shopify Product Upload**
    *   Description: Verify that the application can upload the transformed product data to Shopify using the Shopify API.
    *   Completion Criterion: The application successfully uploads the product data to Shopify without errors. The products are created or updated in Shopify with the correct data, including the JSON formatted metafield. This can be verified by querying the Shopify API for the created/updated products and comparing the data with the source data.

### Phase 2: Web Dashboard Tests

*   **Test Case 2.1: User Login**
    *   Description: Verify that an authorized user can log in to the web dashboard using valid credentials.
    *   Completion Criterion: The user can successfully log in to the web dashboard with valid credentials and is redirected to the dashboard's main page. This can be verified by checking the response status code and the presence of a session cookie or token.
*   **Test Case 2.2: Manual Sync Trigger**
    *   Description: Verify that an authorized user can manually trigger a product sync from the web dashboard.
    *   Completion Criterion: The user can click the "Run Product Sync Now" button, and the dashboard displays a message indicating that the sync has started. A new entry is added to the sync history table with the status "Sync started..." This can be verified by checking the dashboard's UI elements and the sync history table.
*   **Test Case 2.3: Sync History View**
    *   Description: Verify that an authorized user can view the history and status of recent product syncs on the web dashboard.
    *   Completion Criterion: The user can view a table with the history of recent syncs, including the date/time of the sync, its status (e.g., "Completed successfully," "Failed"), the number of products processed, and a summary of any errors. Each entry in the table has a timestamp, a status indicator, and a summary of the number of products processed and errors encountered, all of which can be extracted and verified.

### Phase 3: Automated Sync Tests

*   **Test Case 3.1: Scheduled Sync Execution**
    *   Description: Verify that the system automatically runs a product sync at its scheduled time.
    *   Completion Criterion: The system automatically runs a product sync at the scheduled time without manual intervention. A new entry is added to the sync history table with the status "Completed successfully" or "Failed," along with the number of products processed and any errors. The successful execution of the sync at the scheduled time, and the presence of a corresponding log entry, can be verified by monitoring the system's logs and the sync history table.

### Phase 4: Real-World Scenario Tests

*   **Test Case 4.1: Inventory Clash**
    *   Description: Simulate concurrent updates from Shopify admin and feed API.
    *   Completion Criterion: The system resolves the inventory clash without data loss or errors. The final inventory level in Shopify is correct and reflects the combined updates from both sources. This requires monitoring and comparing the inventory levels before and after the concurrent updates.
*   **Test Case 4.2: Multi-Marketplace Sync**
    *   Description: Test conflicting attribute requirements between platforms.
    *   Completion Criterion: The system correctly handles the conflicting attribute requirements and uploads the product data to each marketplace without errors. The product data in each marketplace conforms to the specific requirements of that marketplace. This can be verified by querying the APIs of each marketplace and comparing the data with the expected values.
*   **Test Case 4.3: Historical Data Drift**
    *   Description: Compare current feed output against a 6-month-old valid dataset.
    *   Completion Criterion: The system identifies and flags any significant data drift between the current feed output and the 6-month-old dataset. The flagged data drift is reported in the logs with a summary of the changes. This requires comparing the current data with the historical data and identifying any discrepancies.

### Phase 5: Performance and Security Tests

*   **Test Case 5.1: Rate Limiting**
    *   Description: Implement tests to verify that the application handles API rate limits gracefully, avoiding errors and ensuring that all data is synchronized.
    *   Completion Criterion: The application handles API rate limits without errors. All data is synchronized to Shopify, and no API rate limit errors are logged. This requires monitoring the API call frequency and error logs.
*   **Test Case 5.2: Error Handling**
    *   Description: Test the application's ability to handle API errors, such as invalid product data or connection errors.
    *   Completion Criterion: The application handles API errors gracefully and logs the errors with sufficient detail for debugging. The application continues to synchronize the remaining data without interruption. This requires injecting errors into the API calls and monitoring the application's behavior and logs.
*   **Test Case 5.3: Data Masking**
    *   Description: Implement data masking techniques to protect sensitive data while using real data in testing.
    *   Completion Criterion: Sensitive data is masked in the logs and any other output generated during testing. The masked data is unreadable and cannot be used to identify real users or products. This requires inspecting the logs and other output to ensure that sensitive data is properly masked.
*   **Test Case 5.4: Secure Data Transfer**
    *   Description: Ensure secure transmission of data.
    *   Completion Criterion: All data is transferred securely using HTTPS. This can be verified by checking the network traffic and ensuring that all data is encrypted.

## Principles of Good High-Level Tests

This test plan adheres to the following principles of good high-level tests:

*   **Understandable:** Tests are written in a clear and concise manner, easily understood by stakeholders.
*   **Maintainable:** The test suite is designed to be easily updated and maintained as the application evolves.
*   **Independent:** Tests are independent of each other, avoiding dependencies that can lead to cascading failures.
*   **Reliable:** Tests produce consistent results, minimizing false positives and negatives.
*   **Feedback:** Tests provide clear and actionable feedback, enabling developers to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## API Integrations Testing

*   **Authentication:** Verify that the application can authenticate with the Shopify API and the Etilize FTP server using valid credentials.
*   **Data Transfer:** Ensure that product data is transferred correctly between the Etilize FTP server and the Shopify API.
