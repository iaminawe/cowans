# System Architecture: Cowans Office Supplies Integration System

## 1. Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the Cowans Office Supplies Integration System, which automates the synchronization of product data between Etilize and Shopify. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and testable, following the principles of the SPARC framework. It adheres to the AI verifiable tasks and high-level acceptance tests defined in `PRDMasterPlan.md` and `tests/acceptance/core_functionality_test_plan.md`.

## 2. Modules

The system is composed of three main modules:

*   **Core Integration Module:** Handles the core data synchronization logic.
*   **Web Dashboard Module:** Provides a user interface for manual sync triggering and log viewing.
*   **Authentication and Scheduling Module:** Manages user authentication and scheduled data synchronization.

## 3. Core Integration Module

### 3.1. Components

*   **FTP Downloader:** Connects to the Etilize FTP server, downloads the product data file.
*   **Data Transformer:** Parses the CSV data, transforms it into JSON metafields suitable for Shopify.
*   **Shopify Uploader:** Connects to the Shopify API, uploads the transformed product data.

### 3.2. Technology

*   Python

### 3.3. Data Flow

FTP Downloader -> Data Transformer -> Shopify Uploader

### 3.4. Testing

Unit tests for each component, integration tests for the data flow, end-to-end tests to verify the entire process. Adheres to London School TDD principles as defined in `tests/acceptance/core_functionality_test_plan.md`.

### 3.5. AI Verifiable Tasks Supported

*   1.2. Implement FTP Download Module
*   1.3. Implement Data Transformation
*   1.4. Implement Shopify Integration
*   1.5. Create Core Test Suite

## 4. Web Dashboard Module

### 4.1. Components

*   **Frontend (React/TypeScript):** User interface for the dashboard.
*   **Backend (Flask):** API endpoints for triggering syncs and retrieving logs.

### 4.2. Technology

*   React, TypeScript, Flask

### 4.3. Data Flow

User interaction in Frontend -> API call to Backend -> Trigger Core Integration Module -> Retrieve logs from Core Integration Module -> Display logs in Frontend

### 4.4. Testing

Unit tests for React components, integration tests for API endpoints, end-to-end tests to verify the dashboard functionality.

### 4.5. AI Verifiable Tasks Supported

*   2.1. Set up Frontend Project
*   2.2. Implement Dashboard UI
*   2.3. Create Sync Control Interface
*   2.4. Implement Log Viewer

## 5. Authentication and Scheduling Module

### 5.1. Components

*   **Supabase Integration:** Handles user authentication and authorization.
*   **Scheduler:** Schedules the data synchronization process.

### 5.2. Technology

*   Supabase, Python (for scheduling)

### 5.3. Data Flow

User authentication via Supabase -> Scheduler triggers Core Integration Module at scheduled intervals.

### 5.4. Testing

Unit tests for authentication, integration tests for scheduling, end-to-end tests to verify the entire process.

### 5.5. AI Verifiable Tasks Supported

*   3.1. Set up Supabase Integration
*   3.2. Implement User Authentication
*   3.3. Create Sync Scheduler
*   3.4. Security Implementation
*   3.5. Performance Testing

## 6. Shared Components

*   **Logging Service:** Centralized logging for all modules.
*   **Configuration Manager:** Manages application configuration.

## 7. Technology Choices

*   **Python:** For core data processing and integration tasks.
*   **React/TypeScript:** For the web dashboard frontend.
*   **Flask:** For the web dashboard backend API.
*   **Supabase:** For user authentication and authorization.

## 8. Security Considerations

*   All API endpoints should be protected with authentication and authorization.
*   Data should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
*   Credentials should be stored securely using environment variables and secrets management.
*   Regular security audits should be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## 9. Scalability Considerations

*   The system should be designed to handle large volumes of product data.
*   Batch processing should be used to improve performance.
*   The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased load.
*   Caching should be used to reduce database load.

## 10. Future Considerations

*   Implement monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to issues.
*   Implement a rollback strategy to quickly recover from failures.
*   Implement automated deployment to streamline the release process.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the Cowans Office Supplies Integration System. It is designed to be modular, scalable, and testable, and it supports the AI verifiable tasks and high-level acceptance tests defined in the project specifications.
